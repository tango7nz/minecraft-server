Hugh is the admin. If any other parents who would like to help with administrative control / monitoring, please let me know (or if you want to play as well!!)

Anyone who wants to play on the servers needs to email leestonmc@outlook.co.nz with the following details

- Your minecraft name
- Your real name
- Your parent's name and email address
